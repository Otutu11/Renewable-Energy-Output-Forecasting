# Renewable Energy Output Forecasting

![Energy Forecasting Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Renewable+Energy+Forecasting+Workflow)
> Accurate prediction of renewable energy generation using machine learning

This project provides a robust pipeline for forecasting renewable energy output (solar/wind) using weather data and historical generation patterns. The system employs both tree-based models (XGBoost) and sequence models (LSTM) to predict energy generation with high accuracy.

## Key Features
- 🌀 Synthetic data generation for renewable energy systems
- ⚡ Hybrid modeling approach (XGBoost + LSTM)
- 📈 Advanced feature engineering (temporal features, lag features, interactions)
- 🔍 Comprehensive model evaluation and visualization
- 🚀 Production-ready pipeline architecture
- 📊 Interactive result visualizations

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Akajiaku1/Renewable-Energy-Output-Forecasting.git
cd Renewable-Energy-Output-Forecasting

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
1. Generate Sample Data
bash

python generate_sample_data.py

Generates a synthetic dataset with 1 year of hourly energy data in data/raw/energy_data.csv
2. Run Full Pipeline
bash

python run_pipeline.py

This executes:

    Data preprocessing and cleaning

    Feature engineering

    Model training (XGBoost and LSTM)

    Model evaluation

    Visualization of results

3. Customize Configuration

Modify config.py for:

    Dataset parameters

    Feature selection

    Model hyperparameters

    Training settings

4. Explore Results

Check the following directories after pipeline execution:

    models/: Trained model files

    results/: Performance visualizations

    data/processed/: Cleaned and processed data

Customization

To use with your own dataset:

    Place CSV file in data/raw/

    Update config.py:
    python

    DATA_PATH = 'data/raw/your_data.csv'
    TARGET = 'your_target_column'
    FEATURES = ['your', 'feature', 'columns']

    Adjust feature engineering in src/feature_engineering.py as needed
